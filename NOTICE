This project includes code inspired by the following MIT-licensed repositories:

1. Flappy Bird (Phaser 3): https://github.com/usmansbk/flappy-bird
   - Used for game logic structure and Phaser 3 implementation patterns
   - All assets and sprites have been replaced with our own placeholders

2. Stack (Three.js): https://github.com/KonradLinkowski/Stack
   - Used for Three.js game logic and stacking mechanics
   - Simplified implementation with our own placeholder graphics

3. Memory Game (Vanilla JS): https://github.com/taniarascia/memory
   - Used for memory matching game logic and card flip mechanics
   - Adapted to our React/TypeScript architecture

All original code has been rewritten and adapted for our specific use case.
